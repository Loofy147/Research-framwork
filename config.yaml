# This file defines the experiments to be run by the MetaOrchestrator.
# It allows for a declarative approach to configuring benchmarks.

experiments:
  - name: "Adversarial Robustness Test for Text Parsing"
    # The type of experiment. The orchestrator can use this to decide which method to call.
    type: "adversarial_benchmark"

    # The adversarial agent responsible for generating the challenging context.
    adversarialVariant: "SimpleAdversarialVariant"

    # The list of target agents that will be tested against the generated context.
    targetVariants:
      - "BasicParserAgent" # A hypothetical simple agent.
      - "AdvancedParserAgent" # A hypothetical more advanced agent.

    # The initial context provided to the adversarial agent to start the process.
